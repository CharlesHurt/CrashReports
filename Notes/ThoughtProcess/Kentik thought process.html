<div>6-10-2016</div>
<div>Talked with Mike Ho</div>
<div>Learned there would be a small development challenge using D3.</div>
<div>Began learning D3 using online resources.  (See D3 notes)</div>
<div>Used Lynda.com and Introduction to D3 w/Curran Kelleher </div>
<div>Approximately 3 hours</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6-11</div>
<div>Read customer spec (Burkes request)</div>
<div>Dissected data file, observed it was JSON data for named neighborhoods.</div>
<div>Identified useable information:</div>
<div>1) Polygon of data points outlining named neighborhoods</div>
<div>2) The number of events in that neighborhood by year</div>
<div>3) Total area of neighborhood</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Concluded ideal app should be an interactive map employing Google Maps</div>
<div>with an overlay of outlined neighborhoods.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6-13</div>
<div>Realized there was an opportunity to demonstrate engineering skills in several ways.</div>
<div>Will use Git for submission of D3 notes, Spec, Code, thought process.</div>
<div>Decided, Google maps API would take too much time but making the graphics SVG scallable</div>
<div>would be the foundation for making app Mobile-friendly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Decided the title of app should impart its limited scope.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Assuming I am a company contracted to develop this app,  I would have gathered all</div>
<div>people with a vested interest in this project to contribute to the spec with the goal in mind</div>
<div>of carefully limiting the scope.  Key to this process would be all questions regarding the</div>
<div>spec would be answered by client.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PITFALLS:</div>
<div>What is not stated in the original spec? </div>
<div>How might the spec expand in the future in a way that would make the original proposal non-scalable?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>OPPORTUNITIES:</div>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to include AJAX to emphasize the SPA-ness and demonstrate a RESTful API</li>
<li>End points for the RESTful API would include: users, neighborhoods, both of which support SCALABILITY</li>
<li>It would be nice to demonstrate an authorization process</li>
<li>It would be nice to include a Mongo/Mongoose backend</li>
<li>In support of Mobile-friendliness, D3 scaling can be leveraged</li>
<li>In the case of extremely small screen real-estate, the neighborhood outline would simply be a polygon/shape with fill.</li>
</ul>
